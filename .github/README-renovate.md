# No Gradle Dependency Updates

This repository contains **Java POJO classes for IATA ONE Record** (1R), as per
official IATA Ontology on GitHub at https://github.com/IATA-Cargo/ONE-Record.

To ensure compatibility with 
[IATA-Cargo/one-record-server-java](https://github.com/IATA-Cargo/one-record-server-java),
the libraries used will not be used with their latest version but with the version which are used
in that project. 

This is the reason why the "gradle" manager for Renovate has been disabled.
